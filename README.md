We abandoned this git repo because we had an issue with our gitignore which then led to trying to upload files that were too large (which we then didn't notice for a long time until it just became simpler to start anew rather than to untangle the many intermixed pushes some of which weren't pushed).


Here are photos of Nick's pushes: (he's smithn10, the bright blue line on the left of all the commits because his commits were only ever local)
